This file contains the codebook associated with the Getting and Cleaning Data project assignment on Coursera.

The purpose of the codebook is to document the tidy dataset that is produced by the run_analysis.R script. Refer to the README.md file for instructions on how to produce the tidy dataset from the raw project data.

The structure of the Tidy Dataset is as follows:

COLUMN      DATA TYPE      DESCRIPTION
subjectID   integer        Identify person who collected the raw data (1 to 30)

                           3:STANDING,4:WALKING, 5:WALKING UPSTAIRS, 6: WALKING DOWNSTAIRS)
variable    number         Each variable contains the value of a single feature. The Tidy Dataset includes the mean and
